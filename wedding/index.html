      What is the gospel?
    </h1>
    <p>
The gospel is the understanding of the world and the purpose of life as revealed in the Christian Bible. It says that God created the universe and created human beings to live in a loving relationship with him. But since the first human being, every one of us has rejected God as our maker and chosen to live according to our own will. The Bible calls this rebellion against God sin. Sin is why the world is cursed with disease and death, broken relationships, and injustice. It’s why every human being is destined to physically die and then suffer eternally as just punishment for rejecting God and his design for us.
    </p>
    <p>
But there’s good news! God loved his creation so much that he made a way for us to be saved and restored to a loving relationship with him. Two thousand years ago, he became a human being himself, Jesus Christ. He lived a life of perfect obedience to God, yet gave himself up to suffer and die on a cross, taking the punishment for our sin upon himself. Three days later, he rose from the dead, showing that God’s penalty for sin had been fully paid.
    </p>
    <p>
Because God paid for our sin debt himself, we can now be restored to a loving relationship with him and destined for eternal joy with him, if we believe in Jesus and accept his work to save us. This is the amazing reality that the Bible passage we read in our wedding ceremony was talking about: “Christ loved the church [i.e. those who believe in him] and gave himself up for her” (Eph 5:25). We pray that by God’s grace our marriage will be a picture of such selfless love.

If you’ve never seriously considered the message of the Bible before, we invite you to take a closer look. We believe that in it you will find an explanation of the world, human experience, and the meaning of life that makes more sense and brings more joy than any other. Here are some resources to help you do that:

      福音是什么？
    </h1>
    <p>
    福音是圣经所启示对世界的理解和人生的目的讲述。它表示上帝创造了宇宙并创造了人类,
    并与他原本有一种爱的关系。但是从第一个人开始，我们每个人都拒绝了我们的创造者上帝，而选择按照自己的意愿生活。圣经称这种对上帝的背叛为罪。罪使世界被咒诅满了病痛和死亡、破碎的人际关系和不公义的事。这就是为什么每个人都注定要在肉体上死去，然后永远的苦难，作为拒绝上帝的惩罚。
    </p>
    <p>
    但有好消息！上帝非常爱他的创造，他为我们开辟了一条道路，让我们可以得救并恢复与他的爱的关系。两千多年前，他自己成为了人，耶稣基督。他过着完全顺服上帝的生活，却甘愿受苦并死在十字架上，将我们的罪的惩罚归咎于他自己。三天后，他从死里复活，表明上帝对罪的惩罚已经完全付了代价。
    </p>
    <p>
    因为上帝亲自偿还了我们的罪债，如果我们相信耶稣并接受他拯救我们的工作，我们现在就可以恢复与他的爱，并注定与他一起享受永恒的快乐。这就是我们在婚礼上读到的圣经经节：“正如基督爱教会(凡信祂的)，为教会舍己，”（以弗所书5:25）。我们祈祷，靠着上帝的恩典，我们的婚姻将成为这种舍己的爱的图画。
    </p>
    <p>
