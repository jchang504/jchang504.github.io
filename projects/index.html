            <h1>Code Projects</h1>
            <p>This list includes basically every serious project I've ever
            started. Many of them only got that far, a few are complete (as
            they'll ever be), and some are in active development.</p>

            <h2>In Active Development</h2>

            <h3 id="keeptabs">KeepTabs</h3>
            <p>A Chrome extension that enables you to quickly navigate between
            tabs with highly-customizable keyboard shortcuts. Initially born of
            TartanHacks 2017, we've fixed up the hacky code and added a lot of
            features to make this into a pretty useful app that I now can't use
            my browser without. There are a few more things we need to finish
            to make it customizable to any user, and then we're going to
            release it on the Chrome Web Store. If you want to try it out in
            the meantime, just clone the GitHub repo and load it as an unpacked
            extension.</p>

            <h3 id="colortasker">Colortasker</h3>
            <p>A Chrome extension that adds color shading to your Google
            calendar weekly or custom view (try a 7-day custom view instead of
            weekly; it's life-changing) to help you instantly visualize how
            busy you are on each day, making time and task management fast and
            intuitive. It's specifically designed with my own calendar-based
            task scheduling system in mind, which involves creating all-day
            events with time estimates in their titles to schedule and keep
            track of tasks. Right now it works completely off the UI,
            essentially scraping your event data off of the page. This leaves
            some problems and limitations (not to mention the possibility of
            breaking at any time if Google Calendar changes the UI), so I plan
            to get it working off the Calendar API at some point.</p>

                    Evaluation</h3>
            <p>For our final project in 15-418 (Parallel Computer Architecture
            and Programming; that's why we use the numbers at CMU), Nancy Xiao
            and I implemented, measured, and compared the performance of
            sequential and parallel algorithms for game tree evaluation using
            minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and principal variation splitting on a
            12-core machine. Fun fact: this was the last assignment I submitted
            to complete my undergraduate education at CMU. I slept for 13 hours
            that night.</p>

            <h3 id="biblelatex">Bible Reference LaTeX Preprocessor</h3>
            <p>A Python script for inserting short Bible passages into a LaTeX

            <h3 id="lettercrush">Lettercrush</h3>
            <p>My first large JavaScript project written during the summer
            after my freshman year at CMU. It's a complete rewrite of my high
            school senior project, a Java application with an interactive GUI
            that allowed the user to enter <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424">Letterpress</a>
            games and moves and calculated the best moves to make. When I last
            worked on it there were a number of UI bugs, but the AI logic
            itself is decently well-tested and it, like its predecessor, plays
            a mean game of Letterpress.</p>

            <h3 id="nlp-term-project">NLP Term Project</h3>
            <p>Our term project in 11-411 Natural Language Processing at CMU
            was to build a system to ask and answer intelligent questions based
            on Wikipedia articles. Somehow, my team won 3rd place (of 17) in
            the question asking component. The short video below explains what
            we implemented in our system, and the (very messy) code is hosted
            on GitHub.</p>

            <p>A Chrome extension that removes reaction-related UI elements
            from desktop Facebook. Initially hacked to get rid of excessive
            notifications from likes on photo albums, I added support for
            reaction counters and buttons as well and I've really come to enjoy
            the freedom of interacting online without their (I believe mostly
            negative) psychological effects.</p>

            <h2>Started...</h2>

            <h3 id="tailor">Tailor</h3>
            <p>I think I was learning how to do OOP in Python at the time and
            had also recently taken NLP, so I came up with a project to
            practice both by generating song lyrics. I also went in very hard
            on TDD at the time... but I didn't get many actual features done.
            Nonetheless, it's runnable and I had some fun generating songs
            based off its namesake songwriter's work.</p>
