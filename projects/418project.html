            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                We investigated how to best achieve speedup with a multi-core
                CPU in the task of game tree evaluation. From a baseline of
                sequential minimax, we implemented and optimized the runtime of
                parallel minimax and sequential and parallel alpha-beta pruning
                algorithms, testing them on Gomoku (generalized Tic-Tac-Toe) on
                the latedays cluster.

            <p>
                Overall, we specified the number of plies (depth of the game
                tree), trials and turns to run for the game. After running the
                game for the specified number of turns, each to the specified
                depth in the game tree, we recorded the output: time in seconds
                it took to complete those turns. Implementation-wise, we wanted
                a generalized version that could work with any solver algorithm
                and any two-player combinatorial game. As such, we created two
                interfaces: one for games and the other for various solvers.

                            Gomoku - A generalized version of Tic-Tac-Toe. It
                            has two parameters: n and k. n represents the width
                            and height of the board. k represents the number of
                            same pieces in a row (diagonally, horizontally, or
                            vertically) a player needs to win. We chose Gomoku
                            because it has a high branching factor. For this
                            game, there is low memory usage and simple state
                            evaluation computation. The central region of the
                            board requires more computation than the borders.

                            game by minimizing the worst case scenario. It
                            searches the game tree to the specified depth,
                            calculating the value of each children based off a
                            heuristic, and determines the best possible move.
                            Minimax can be parallelized by computing the moves
                            (child nodes) in parallel. See proposal below for

                            in goal and purpose. The key difference is that it
                            prunes away (does not compute or evaluate) the
                            branches (moves) that are evidently worse by
                            looking at the results of the previously computed
                            branches. This algorithm is inherently sequential.
                            We will be spending the bulk of our time
                            parallelizing this well to achieve speedup.

                            Principal Variation Splitting: The purpose of
                            principal variation splitting is to start the
                            parallel alpha-beta threads with a decent starting
                            alpha-beta bound to yield more pruning. It does
                            this by sequentially running the leftmost child to
                            get starting alpha-beta bounds to evaluate the
                            remaining children in parallel with. This approach
                            assumes that the leftmost child is a decent (and
                            hopefully very good) move. The better the leftmost
                            child is as a move, the more it can prune away in
                            the parallel run of the rest of the children. The
                            sequential aspect is not that bad as the PVS
                            algorithm is recursive, evaluating the remaining
                            children of each level in parallel so our cores are
                            never sitting idle.

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
                First, we designed the interfaces in which we worked. This
                includes the game interface and the solver interface (for more
                details see the background section). From there, we implemented
                both the games and the solvers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, we wanted to implement chess as at each step, there
                are a lot of possible moves (and therefore a high branching
                factor) and would benefit from minimax and alphabeta pruning.
                We realized that it would be more worth our time to implement
                and improve upon the parallel solvers, especially the
                alpha-beta pruning algorithm, so we stopped implementing chess.
                However, we still needed to implement a game to test the
                solvers (baseline and improvements). We decided to implement
                Tic-Tac-Toe. Because there weren’t too many turns to simulate,
                we opted for a more generalized version of Tic-Tac-Toe (nxn
                board must get n in a row). However, that game tends to tie
                quickly and the range of values for possible moves is narrow,
                so we decided to implement othello, until we realized that
                othello also does not have a very high branching factor.
                Ultimately, we implemented Gomoku, an even more generalized
                version of Tic-Tac-Toe as one wins with k in a row on a nxn
                board. We also had to design a heuristic (evaluation function
                of a leaf node/move) to the best of our ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the solvers, we started by implementing the baselines:
                sequential minimax, parallel minimax, sequential alphabeta and
                parallel alphabeta. For the first parallel solvers, we used
                OpenMP where each thread is statically assigned a chunk of the
                moves to evaluate. In this way, we achieved a 12x speedup
                (number of processors in a latedays cluster) from sequential to
                parallel minimax. However, we didn’t achieve such ideal speedup
                from sequential to parallel alpha beta pruning (only 5.8x
                speedup). (We also implemented alternative versions of each
                that either copied the game before playing a candidate move and
                evaluating its value, or just playing the move on the game,
                evaluating, then undoing it. The latter we supposed would
                reduce time spent copying arrays, but it turned out to make
                little difference, since the rest of the computation
                (evaluation heuristic) dominated.) Thinking that our parallel
                alpha-beta might have sub-optimal speedup because of contention
                over global variables (alpha, beta, best_score, best_move), we
                decided to implement another version of OpenMP parallel
                alpha-beta pruning that kept a thread-local version of all
                those variables and combined them at the end, as well as global
                and thread-local versions of parallel minimax. In this way,
                there would be less writes to the same chunk of memory. Upon
                testing, we saw that the global and local version of minimax
                were taking the same amount of time consistently and realized
                that there actually isn’t much contention, since the variables
                are updated relatively infrequently given the long tree
                evaluation computation that occurs between each potential
                update. We also noticed that the global alpha beta pruning
                solver was consistently faster than the local one. This is
                because the local version does not prune away as many branches
                as the global version does, since each thread obtains a worse
                thread-local alpha-beta bound in its course than it would if it
                shared a global one. See Figure 1.

                In order to further improve the parallelization and achieve
                greater speedup of alpha-beta pruning, we tried implementing
                principal variation splitting. We tried three methods of
                choosing the leftmost child (the move we hope to be fairly good
                as so to prune away more branches later): first move, random
                move, and best move (please see results below to understand the
                differences in outcome of the three methods).
            </p>

            <p>
                For all of our evaluation, we used a 15x15 Gomoku game with
                5-in-a-row to win. We made 10 consecutive turns each searching
                to a depth of 3 in the game tree to find the best move
                according to minimax (correct pruning doesn’t change the final
                move chosen, modulo ties). We ran these evaluations for each
                different solving algorithm (sequential minimax, sequential
                alpha-beta, parallel alpha-beta, PVS, etc.) from each of two
                starting positions: an empty board (initial position) and an
                intermediate position (10 turns in). We measured wall clock
                time to complete the 10 turns. The goal was to minimize the
                ratio of parallel algorithm wall clock time to sequential
                algorithm wall clock time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our baselines are sequential minimax and sequential alpha-beta
                algorithms. For scale, it’s interesting to note that sequential
                alpha-beta runs 12x faster than sequential minimax due to
                pruning. Parallel minimax implemented with OpenMP achieved ~12x
                speedup over sequential, as expected from the 12 physical cores
                on latedays. Our basic parallel alpha-beta implemented with
                OpenMP achieved 5.8x speedup over sequential alpha-beta,
                roughly half of the ideal speedup. See Figure 2.

                We implemented Principal Variation Splitting, an improvement on
                our simple parallel alpha-beta, to increase its pruning and
                reduce computation. The success of PVS depended on how the
                principal variation (the move evaluated sequentially to obtain
                an initial alpha-beta bound) was selected; the better the PV
                move, the better bound it yields, leading to more pruning.
                Choosing the first available move as PV demonstrated
                performance worse than the basic parallel alpha-beta, probably
                due to the extra initial sequential work of PVS. The first move
                does not yield a useful bound at the stages of the game we
                evaluated on because it is in the corner of the board, too far
                from existing placed pieces. Choosing a random move as PV
                performed better, balancing out the overhead of PVS to get
                equal performance with our basic parallel alpha-beta, but a
                randomly chosen move is still most likely to be bad. Finally,
                using the leaf node heuristic to evaluate moves and select the
                best one according to its score to use as PV yielded runtime
                about 20% shorter than the basic parallel alpha-beta,
                representing a final best speedup of 7.2x faster runtime than
                the sequential alpha-beta algorithm. The results shown below
                are all when starting from an initial state of the board. From
                the intermediate state, all of our PVS algorithms yielded
                performance equal to or worse than the basic parallel
                alpha-beta, especially the heuristic selector. We hypothesize
                that the simple heuristic function we used gives an inadequate
                estimate of the value of intermediate positions, although it
                works reasonably well towards the initial state of the game.
                See Figure 3.

                We are still far short of the ideal 12x speedup from our 12
                physical cores. We hypothesize that this is due to workload
                imbalance between the static chunks assigned to each core,
                since by nature of pruning some of them will find better
                alpha-beta bounds earlier and prune a lot more computation,
                finishing earlier than others and waiting. The workload
                imbalance is exacerbated by the use of PVS, since starting with
                a better bound enables earlier and more variable pruning, and
                the amount of computation pruned is highly dependent on the
                static region of the board assigned to the core (since moves
                were generated in row-major order), and the center of the board
                usually contains the better moves. We did not have time to
                complete extensive analysis to measure workload imbalance, but
                examining thread timings a bit suggested that occasionally some
                threads do finish orders of magnitude earlier than others. A
                dynamic work scheduling or stealing algorithm such as Dynamic
                Tree Splitting (DTS) as suggested in our initial proposal would
                help alleviate this inefficiency.

            <h2>Updated Goals and Deliverables</h2>
            <p>
                Our goals have not changed. We still plan on finding the
                optimal algorithm to parallelize the minimax algorithm by
                parallelizing minimax, implementing sequential and parallel
                alpha-beta pruning, and finally improving the parallel
                alpha-beta pruning algorithm by implementing principal
                variation splitting (PVS). We were hoping to have enough time
                to implement Dynamic Tree Split. However, we aren’t too hopeful
                as it is a tricky algorithm and the next few weeks are looking
                a bit rough. We might be able to try simpler improvements such
                as iterative deepening or jamboree. For the demo we still plan
                to present speedup graphs (and we'll try to compute win rates
                from pitting various solvers against each other under time
                constraints, because it’s cool, but if we don't get to that
                it's not our main metric anyway.)

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                We will investigate how to best achieve speedup with a
                multi-core CPU in the task of game tree evaluation. From a
                baseline of sequential minimax, we will implement and optimize
                speedup of parallel minimax and a few sequential and parallel
                alpha-beta pruning algorithms (Principal Variation Splitting,
                iterative deepening, Dynamic Tree Splitting), testing it on
                various games such as Chess on the latedays cluster.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The minimax algorithm is used to find the best next move in a
                game by minimizing the worst case scenario. Parallelizing
                minimax is fairly intuitive as it involves spawning threads for
                each node (next possible move) and running those in parallel.

            </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, a lot of the speedup from parallelizing the
                algorithm is unnecessary as many branches could have been
                pruned, e.g. with the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. Alpha-beta
                pruning is an algorithm that speeds up the minimax search on a
                game decision tree by not fully evaluating branches that cannot
                be the best choice given the results already achieved in
                previously evaluated choices.

            </p>
            <p>
                To parallelize the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, we will
                implement the Principal Variation Splitting and Dynamic Tree
                Splitting algorithms. The Principal Variation Splitting (PVS)
                algorithm represents each node on the decision tree as a
                thread. In order words, each move is a thread. In order to set
                the alpha and beta values, the PVS algorithm runs the first
                child sequentially. Then using the alpha-beta bounds obtained,
                it runs the other children nodes in parallel with those values.
                Sometimes, for ideal alpha beta values, there might not be a
                need to run the other children. This reduces contention of
                alpha beta global variables, allowing for more efficient
                parallel execution. Unfortunately, since some moves will be
                pruned, some threads will be idle while they wait for other
                children threads to finish, leading to load imbalance. There
                are some ways to remedy this, including Enhanced PVS, iterative
                deepening, and Dynamic Tree Splitting. Iterative deepening
                reorders the nodes at each iteration according to a shallower
                evaluation such that the first node the PVS would run
                sequentially would ideally be the best value and therefore
                reduce the number of parallel runs. Dynamic Tree Splitting is
                much like PVS with work-stealing as each node reports its state
                so that free threads can look at these states and decide
                whether it can help that node finish its work. It does this by
                splitting a block. If the free thread does decide to join in on
                the work, the current state of that heavy-work node will be
                added into shared memory and the two threads will split the
                block.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, we will be parallelizing across nodes (each a thread)
                for each level, pruning off branches that are not very useful,
                reorganizing work, and redistributing/splitting up work for
                better load balance.
            </p>
            </section>
            <section id="challenge">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, the minimax algorithm is compute-intensive and needs
                little memory bandwidth. Parallelizing alpha-beta pruning is
                the main challenge of this project, because pruning inherently
                works because of its sequential dependencies -- you avoid doing
                work by knowing that it is unnecessary given the previous work
                you’ve done. Naively trying to globally share and update the
                alpha-beta values would lead to extreme contention which could
                actually result in slowdown compared to sequential alpha-beta.
                To combat this, we will implement the Principal Variation
                Splitting (PVS) algorithm as described in the <a
                href="#background">background</a> section. Unfortunately, PVS
                is susceptible to severe load imbalance as some threads are
                left idle when their branch gets pruned. Dynamic Tree Splitting
                (as described in the <a href="#background">background</a>
                section), a hard-to-implement algorithm, helps to overcome this
                problem.

                Parallelize minimax with multi-threading on CPU; goal: achieve
                linear speedup with number of cores</li>
                <li>Implement sequential alpha-beta pruning; measure speedup
                against sequential and parallel minimax (we expect that
                sequential alpha-beta pruning will provide better speedup than
                parallel minimax)</li>
                <li>Implement parallel alpha-beta pruning with PVS; goal: 0.5p
                speedup with p cores (note: not really sure whether this is too
                low or high; we know PVS will not get linear speedup, but have
                to look at papers to see what is a reasonable expectation)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hope to achieve:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement iterative deepening to improve the speedup of PVS
                alpha-beta (hard to set a speedup goal, no precedent)</li>
                <li>Implement DTS to improve the speedup of PVS alpha-beta to
                linear compared to sequential alpha-beta</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How we will demonstrate:</h3>
            <p>
                To demonstrate our project, we will show the speedup graphs of
                all the algorithms we implement. The ultimate baseline for all
                will be the sequential minimax, but the various parallel
                alpha-beta techniques compared to sequential alpha-beta will be
                of particular interest as well. For fun, we will also present
                statistics on the differences in win rate of the different
                algorithms (with a fixed time limit per turn), although the
                main goal is to optimize the parallel algorithm runtime and we
                know this will not necessarily translate directly to linear
                improvements in win rate.

            <h2>Platform Choice</h2>
            <p>
                We will be focusing on achieving speedup from use of a
                multi-core CPU. Since pruning algorithms naturally have strong
                sequential dependencies, very wide parallelism (e.g. SIMD
                execution on GPU) is unlikely to yield very good speedup. We
                plan to code in C++, and we will probably use OpenMP or Cilk as
                Cilk is good with divide and conquer parallel algorithms.
