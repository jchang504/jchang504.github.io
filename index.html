      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
      <p>My name's Jemmin (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" target="_blank">IPA</a>: d&#658;&epsilon;m&#618;n). I hail from Somers, NY (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somers,_NY" target="_blank">home of the American circus</a>!), where I graduated from <a href="http://www.somersschools.org/somershs" target="_blank">Somers High School</a> in 2013, and I'm currently a student at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I'm studying computer science and linguistics, expecting to graduate in May 2017.</p>
      <p>My academic interests include programming of all sorts, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics (especially phonetics, acoustics, and syntactic theory). Some of my work in these areas can be seen on the <a id="projects-link" class="jslink in-section-menu-link">Projects</a> tab, or you can download my <a href="resume.pdf">R&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm also an avid classical musician. I enjoy playing viola and violin in symphony orchestras, chamber groups, and pit orchestras, and I love going to concerts and the opera. Besides music, I spend my free time playing tennis and ping pong, hiking, playing <a href="http://www.cross-tables.com/results.php?p=19459" target="_blank">competitive Scrabble</a>, and making ice cream. If you share any of these interests and would like to see (or play) a concert together, challenge me to a game of sport, or make a delicious batch of strawberry oreo mint ice cream, please <a id="contact-link" class="jslink in-section-menu-link">get in touch</a>!</p>
      <p>For more information about my musical and Scrabbular activities, see the sections in <a id="more-link" class="jslink in-section-menu-link">More</a>.</p>

          <h3>Scrabble</h3>
          <p>Looking for the <a href="/98-252/">98-252 course page</a>?</p> 
          <p>I started playing Scrabble through the <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/school.cfm" target="_blank">School Scrabble</a> program when I was 12 years old. I attended the National School Scrabble Championships in 2008 and 2009, partnering with Danilo Vicioso and Bryan Poellot and finishing 26<sup>th</sup> and <a href="http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/tourneys/2009/nssc/build/player/1/087.html" target="_blank">18<sup>th</sup></a>, respectively. After graduating from 8th grade and becoming too old to play School Scrabble, my Scrabble activity decreased due to the much harder competition in adult tournaments and my getting more involved with music and other activities. Recently, upon starting college at Carnegie Mellon, I've started playing more Scrabble again, and I attend a few tournaments as well as help direct the newly-forming <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/CMUScrabble/" target="_blank">Scrabble Club</a> at CMU.</p>
          <p>In Fall 2014, I am teaching a <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/stuco/index.html" target="_blank">StuCo</a> class called "Wordplay: Fundamentals of Scrabble Strategy." The course number is <a href="/98-252/" target="_blank">98-252</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="music-subsection">Music</h3>
        <p>My love for and involvement in classical music has developed steadily over the years. I began playing viola in the 3<sup>rd</sup> grade with my intermediate school orchestra, and started taking private lessons with Elizabeth Kaplan in high school. Somewhere along the way I picked up a violin, and found that I enjoyed playing that as well.</p>
        <p>I continue to practice and study viola at CMU, and I've played viola and violin in the <a href="http://alluniversityorchestra.org/" target="_blank">All-University Orchestra</a> and String Theory. My favorite, though, is to perform in small chamber ensembles and quartets - so if you're interested in playing something together, please <a id="contact-link" class="jslink in-section-menu-link">let me know</a>!</p>
        <p>My favorite period of music is the transition between the Classical and Romantic periods, and (some of) my favorite composers are Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, and Chopin.</p>
        <h3 id="code-philosophy-subsection">Code Philosophy</h3>
        <p>I hate hacking. This may sound strange coming from an avid programmer, but it's true. For me, the beauty of programming lies in its logical structure and semantic organization. I strive always for the most elegant, cleanest, fastest solution - the right way and the best way to solve the problem at hand. This isn't always easy to find; it requires careful research, lots of reading through thick documentation, and being willing to frequently refactor large chunks of code. But it leaves me with a sense of understanding and satisfaction that copy-pasting an answer from Stack Overflow just can't provide.</p>
        <p>I also believe firmly in clear, easy-to-read, and thorough documentation. This applies to every piece of code I write, from comments in my personal .bashrc to docstrings in a python script to Git commit messages. When I first started programming, I was one of those kids who thought comments were a waste of time. I quickly grew up from that, and I take pride in devoting time and thought to writing well-documented, easy-to-maintain code.</p>
        <p>Though I'm averse to hacky code, I'm certainly not opposed to hackathons. The excitement of charging forward with a brand-new idea and coding for hours and hours without sleep is great, even if the time constraints don't allow for the perfectly methodical programming I prefer. I've participated in HackCMU and TartanHacks at CMU, and I look forward to doing more.</p>
