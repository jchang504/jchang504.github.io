      <p>Hello, world!</p>
      <p>My name's Jemmin (<a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"
      target="_blank">IPA</a>: d&#658;&epsilon;m&#618;n). I hail from Somers,
      NY (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somers,_NY"
      target="_blank">home of the American circus</a>!), where I graduated from
      <a href="http://www.somersschools.org/somershs" target="_blank">Somers
      High School</a> in 2013, and I'm currently a student at <a
      href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon
      University</a>. I'm studying computer science and linguistics, expecting
      to graduate in May 2017.</p>
      <p>My academic interests lie at the intersection of computing, 
      linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Some of my work in these areas
      can be seen on the <a id="projects-link"
      class="jslink in-section-menu-link">Projects</a> tab, or you can download
      my <a href="resume.pdf">R&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>. In my free time, I
      enjoy playing viola and violin, listening to classical music, playing
      tennis and ping pong, hiking,
      <a href="http://www.cross-tables.com/results.php?p=19459"
      target="_blank">competitive Scrabble</a>, and making ice cream.</p>

        <p>Our term project in 11-411 Natural Language Processing at CMU was to
        build a system to ask and answer intelligent questions based on
        Wikipedia articles. Somehow, my team won 3rd place (of 17) in the
        question asking component.</p>

        and the (very messy) code is hosted

        <span class="role">Role: Lead Developer</span>
        <p>Tailor is a Python tool for automatic generation of original song
        lyrics from a N-gram-based language model trained on a set of songs'
        lyrics. I started working on it during summer 2015, so it's still
        young, but you can check out its progress
        <a href="https://github.com/jchang504/tailor" target="_blank">on
        GitHub</a>. I'm happy to partner with one of my oldest friends,
        <a href="http://rohitk.com" target="_blank">Rohit Kapur</a>, on this
        fun project.</p>

        target="_blank">Lettercrush</a>: The world's best Letterpress AI</h3>
        <span class="role">Role: Creator and Developer</span>
        <p>For my high school senior project, I built Letterpress Victory, a
        Java application with an interactive GUI that allowed the user to enter
        <a
        href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424"
        target="_blank">Letterpress</a> games and moves, and calculated the
        best moves to make. As part of the project, I tested my AI against
        similar apps, and found that it well outperformed them (see the video
        for the statistics).</p>
        <p>My knowledge of AI was much smaller at that time, and the
        implementation was quite simple. After a year of CS at CMU, I decided
        to rewrite the app from scratch: new language (JavaScript), new
        algorithms, and - as I soon discovered - many new challenges (mostly
        related to JS...). But the results far exceeded my expectations: as I
        coded, I realized more and more of the design flaws, inefficiencies,
        and downright bugs in my original Java program. By the end, everything
        was different, from the dictionary data structure to the game tree
        exploration algorithm to the GUI layout. And, though I haven't done any
        tests yet, I'm sure Lettercrush performs far better than Letterpress
        Victory did. I still haven't gotten around to polishing the GUI, but
        you can play with it <a href="./lettercrush/" target="_blank">here</a>,
        and see the code <a href="https://github.com/jchang504/lettercrush"
        target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Below is my Letterpress Victory presentation video from high school.
        The algorithms discussed here are long gone in Lettercrush, replaced by
        much more efficient and powerful solutions.</p>

        target="_blank">Whispered Consonants</a></h3>
        <p>In my Phonetics & Phonology (80-282) class in Fall 2014, I conducted
        an experiment to understand how whispering (breathy voice) affects the
        distinguishability between minimal pairs of consonants with respect to
        voicing. Here's the report, titled <a href="./whispered_consonants.pdf"

        <p>For Linguistics of Germanic Languages (80-385) in Spring 2015, I
        wrote a short article on the status of the English subjunctive mood
        called <a href="./english_subjunctive.pdf" target="_blank">Come What

        <h3 id="scrabble-subsection">Scrabble</h3>
        <p>Looking for the <a href="./98-252/">98-252 course page</a>?</p> 
        <p>I started playing Scrabble through the <a
        href="http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/school.cfm"
        target="_blank">School Scrabble</a> program when I was 12 years old. I
        attended the National School Scrabble Championships in 2008 and 2009,
        partnering with Danilo Vicioso and Bryan Poellot and finishing
        26<sup>th</sup> and <a
        href="http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/tourneys/2009/nssc/build/player/1/087.html"
        target="_blank">18<sup>th</sup></a>, respectively. After graduating
        from 8th grade and becoming too old to play School Scrabble, my
        Scrabble activity decreased due to the much harder competition in adult
        tournaments and my getting more involved with music and other
        activities. Recently, upon starting college at Carnegie Mellon, I've
        started playing more Scrabble again and attending a few
        tournaments.</p>
        <p>In Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, I taught a <a
        href="http://www.cmu.edu/stuco/index.html" target="_blank">StuCo</a>
        class called "Wordplay: Fundamentals of Scrabble Strategy." The course
        number is <a href="./98-252/" target="_blank">98-252</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="music-subsection">Music</h3>
        <p>My love for and involvement in classical music has developed
        steadily over the years. I began playing viola in the 3<sup>rd</sup>
        grade with my intermediate school orchestra, and started taking private
        lessons with Elizabeth Kaplan in high school. Somewhere along the way I
        picked up the violin as well.</p>
        <p>I continue to practice and study viola at CMU, and I've played viola
        and violin in the <a href="http://alluniversityorchestra.org/"
        target="_blank">All-University Orchestra</a> and String Theory. My
        favorite, though, is to perform in small chamber ensembles and quartets
        - so if you're interested in playing something together, please <a
        id="contact-link" class="jslink in-section-menu-link">let me
        know</a>!</p>
        <p>My favorite period of music is the transition between the Classical
        and Romantic periods, and (some of) my favorite composers are
        Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, and Chopin.</p>
